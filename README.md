# Simplifying Automotive Damage Processing with Amazon Bedrock and Vector Databases

Assessing the costs related to repairing damages on assets is a challenge that all industries have, in particular automotive companies have had this challenge for a long time. 

There are multiple market solution that leverage Machine Learning processes targeted on addressing this challenge. 

The proposal of this solution is to offer a new method levearging GenAI and MultiModal Vector Databases.



# Deployment steps:


## Step 1: Enable Bedrock Models

## Step 2: Run CloudFormation template

## Step 3: Access inference code
